Decentralized Artificial Intelligence Search For You

Today, most online activity — search, communication, and even creative work — is handled by centralized platforms like Google, OpenAI, or Meta. While these companies offer powerful services, relying on them comes with serious **data privacy risks**:

- **Data Collection & Profiling**  
  Every search, query, or interaction is logged and also linked to your profile. Over time, this builds detailed profiles of individuals, which can be monetized or repurposed without full user consent.

- **Centralized Control**  
  A small number of corporations decide what information is visible, how results are ranked, and what content is restricted — with little transparency.

- **Data Breaches & Misuse**  
  Centralized databases are high-value targets for hackers. Even without breaches, user data may be shared with advertisers, governments, or third parties.

- **Loss of Ownership**  
  Once uploaded, personal data often remains stored indefinitely and may be used to train proprietary AI models without compensation or user control.

- **Chilling Effects & Surveillance**  
  Knowing interactions are constantly monitored leads to self-censorship and reduced freedom of expression.

**DAISY** is a decentralized blockchain platform built on Algorand to counter these risks by:

- Keeping queries and responses **on-chain**, where rules are transparent and auditable.
- Using a **token-based economy** (DAISY ASA) instead of hidden monetization through data.
- Allowing anyone to run or verify an **indexer**, ensuring no single entity controls knowledge access.
- Giving users **true ownership** over their interactions, with cryptographic receipts for accountability.

By decentralizing search, we return **privacy, transparency, and control** back to the community — not corporations.
